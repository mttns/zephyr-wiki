# Albums

**Albums** are a way to display up to 20 cards simultaneously in an easily sharable format.

## Viewing an album

To view an album, simply use **/album** and enter the 5-digit share code. If you'd like to share your album with others, simply give them your album's share code!

You can also view a list of albums belonging to your or another player by using **/albums**. You can then select an album from the list.

## Buying an album

To purchase an album, simply run **/albums** and click the "Buy Album" button. Albums cost **750 Bits** each. You can only own up to 25 albums, but each album can have an unlimited number of pages.

Pages cost **250 Bits** each, plus **25 Bits** per card slot on the page. To purchase your first page, simply view your album with **/album** and click the "Add a page" button. If you'd like to buy more pages, view the album, then click the :bookmark\_tabs:**Buy Page** (center) button.

Each page has its own dimensions, so you can have pages with different sizes in the same album. To set the size of a page before you buy it, click the "Resize" button in the purchase prompt and enter a width and height. Note that page dimensions currently **cannot** be changed after purchase, nor can pages be removed from an album.

## Naming an album

To rename an album, view the album with **/album** and click the :label:**Rename** (rightmost) button. Album names can be up to 16 characters long, and do not need to be unique.

## Adding and removing cards

To edit an album page, view the album with **/album** and click the :pencil2:**Edit** (leftmost) button. A new interface will appear with a button for each slot. Simply click a slot and enter the card code to add it to the album. If you'd like to remove a card, do the same but leave the card code blank.

You can also remove all cards from a page by pressing the :wastebasket:**Clear Page** button.
